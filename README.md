# Reproducibility Code for: "ZeroMod: Optimizing Neural Network Training Dynamics through Targeted Activation Function Modification"

This repository contains the implementation and source code for the experiments presented in the paper as is.

This codebase allows the exact reproduction of the experimental results reported in the paper. The provided scripts were run without modification on the environments described below. Simply run the scripts as-is after setting the desired function and random seed.

- The code does not require any modification beyond selecting the desired function and seed.
- All dependencies are standard and are automatically available on Google Colab / Kaggle by default.
- For GPU acceleration, ensure that your runtime is configured to use a **Tesla T4** or equivalent CUDA 12.4 compatible GPU.
